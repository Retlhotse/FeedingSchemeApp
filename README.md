<h1>Feeding Scheme Mobile Application</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a page to view the menu that the children will be receiving at the school. It also affords parents to view next weeks menu with all the ingredients used, so that parents have a heads up if anything
on the menu is not to their liking. I also added a page to register students and their dietary restrictions.
